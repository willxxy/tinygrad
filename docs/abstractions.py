Welcome to the tinygrad documentation
=================

this file will take you on a whirlwind journey from a Tensor all the way down
tinygrad has been aggressively refactored in the 2.5 years it's been worked on.
what you see here is a refined library (with more refining to go still!)

the whole tinygrad is ~2300 lines, so while it's readable in an evening or two,
this documentation will help with entry points and understanding the abstraction stack
